# Number-Finder
Number Finder is an experimental app where numbers stream and change in real time. Multiple sequences run at once, creating random-looking patterns. Over time, repeated combinations appear and are tracked live. There is no goal or score, just observation. Fully offline, no ads, no data collection.
